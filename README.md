k-NN or Naïve Bayes – Which is Best for Text Classification? (IB EE)

I chose text classification as the topic for my IB Extended Essay (A Mini Research Project). 

This Repository contains the documents, datasets, code and results of my study comparing k-NN and Naive Bayes algorithms on text classification.

If anyone has any problems with my work, please do let me know : rahulr280623@gmail.com ( I will try my best to respond promptly)
